[Invite it to your server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=627860886672900096&permissions=0&scope=bot)

## Installation
Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Create a new `config.json` file at the root of the project directory, as such:
```js
{
    "token": "", // Your bot's token
    "owner": ""  // Your user ID (optional)
}
```

Run `npm start` to start the bot.

## Contribute
I would greatly appreciate stars, issues, forks and pull requests.

Feel free to look at `games/math.js` as a game example to add your own games!<br/>
To add a new game, you just have to add a new javascript file in the `games` folders, it will automatically be added to the bot commands.
